# Employee Database Challenge


~User story: When an user starts the program with `npm start` they are prompted with a list of choices; add employee, update employee, remove employee, view employee, view employees by department, add role, remove roles, view roles, etc. 
~When the user clicks a choice, it will redirect them to a new prompt, show a table, or let them add information into the database, depending on choice.

~Motivation: To make it easier for employers to manage their employees, managers, and departments they work in
